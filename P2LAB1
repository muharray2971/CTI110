 Write a program with a car's gas milage (miles/gallon) and the cost of gas (dollars/gallon) as floating-point input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f}')
